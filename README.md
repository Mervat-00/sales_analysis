# sales_analysis

it is a full data analysis project, the data is about a company sales from 2017 to 2019, 

you can find the data on Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tylermorse/retail-business-sales-20172019),

I did my EDA using python (pandas - numpy - matplotlib ) in jupyter,

I enriched my analysis with tableau to figure more insights, 

I also made the final dashboard using tableau which you can find as .png in provided files.
